# Price-prediction-Regularization-Stacking

Throughout this project, I will be introducing some reproducible functions that can be used in any machine learning project to automate the process:
Data visualization: Functions msv1and msv2to visualize missing values.
Machine learning: Function r_reg does regression with regularization (Ridge, Lasso)
